Now, you've just had an opportunity to see what it looks like to add and remove a class from an element using straight JavaScript. So now what I'd like to do is show you how much easier it is to do it with jQuery. So the first thing we'll do is start off with a selector. So what I'm looking at here, is I want to narrow down to the h2 on the page, and then what I'd like to do is add the class of highlight. So here I'm calling addClass, and I'll pass in the name of the class, which is highlight, and once I execute this statement, you'll notice that the element is now highlighted.

$('h2').addClass('highlight');

Now, that was pretty easy. If we want to remove the class, all we need to do is change this call to removeClass.

$('h2').removeClass('highlight');

And as I execute removeClass, that class is now gone from the element. So this barely scratches the surface, but this gives you a glimpse of the value of using jQuery in your web applications.
